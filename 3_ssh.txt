*********** HOW TO USE SSH FOR AUTHENTICATION ************


### METHOD 1

CACHING CREDENTIALS

git config --global credential.helper cache
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'





### METHOD 2

USING SSH KEY

**Generate an SSH Key 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@id"

**Save the key (leave all places blank)
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:

**Start the SSH Agent in the background
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

**Add your SSH key to SSH agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

**Show your Key and Copy it
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

**Add your SSH key to GitHub
GitHub -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys
New SSH key
Enter title, Key type - Authentication Key, Key - paste your entire key (starts with ssh-rsa, has random characters in between, ends with your email address)
Add SSH key

**Set any Repository as Current Repository to work on via SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yourusername/reponame.git

**List added keys
ssh-add -l

**Test if it is working
ssh -T git@github.com


In the end, you must be shown something similar to this : Hi TechnologyHell! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

cd ~/.ssh
